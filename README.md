# _Unity Capstone | 3D Action Rogue-lite_

#### By _**Trevor Hunter**_

#### _This game is largely inspired by Risk of Rain 2 but with a dark fantasy twist. Fight your way through levels that get harder, earning items to get stronger yourself._

## Technologies Used

* _Unity_
* _C#_
* _PlasticSCM_

## Description

_A level based action rogue-lite where you keep fighting off waves of enemies that get stronger the longer the game goes on. Each level will have items to collect to make yourself more powerful, and a stage boss when you're ready to go to the next level._

_The MVP so far is to have 1 functional level with working combat, and potentially even a few working items_
